# Welcome

---

Welcome to my digital garden - a space for sharing my thoughts and ideas. After many requests and suggestions, I've finally created this platform I've long envisioned. Here, you'll find my personal reflections, including views, ideas, doubts, suggestions, criticisms, experiences, stories, and writings. Everything shared will be either my original thoughts or ideas inspired by those who have influenced me.

> Please note that most content will be in Malayalam or a mix of Malayalam and English, so I apologize to those who don't understand Malayalam.

Let me begin by expressing gratitude to this beautiful world that has shaped who I am.
