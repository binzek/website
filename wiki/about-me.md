I also have a desire that many people have - when talking about myself, I want to say it in the most impressive way. But the problem I've been facing lately is that when I talk about myself, I don't make the same impact I used to. Is it a problem with how I express myself, or is it that I'm no longer in a position to make such claims?

Let's do one thing: I'll slowly add things that I understand about myself here.

However, here's a short description:

My name is Abdul Wajid. I go by the name _binzek_ in online spaces. I'm 19 years old. It's hard to find peers who share my vibe, so it's easier for me to adapt to your vibe. I have a great interest in doing things differently from what everyone else is doing. That must be why, despite having all the facilities, I left home at the age of 17 to experiment, started my career at the age of 18, then went back to college and, as if that wasn't enough, started exploring some non-profit stuff lately.
