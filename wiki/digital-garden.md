# Digital Garden

---

First of all, a special thank you to [Mehar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/meharmp/) and [Sanjay](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sjaykh/).

I first encountered the concept of a digital garden through [Mehar's Kinassery](https://wiki.meharmp.in/) a few months ago. After exploring several other digital gardens, I grasped their significance. A conversation with Sanjay later solidified my decision to create my own.

A digital garden - also known as a personal wiki - is a tool that works differently for everyone. Mine is an experiment. At its core, it's a platform that implements the [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) note-taking method, connecting scattered thoughts and housing them in one accessible online space. Unlike a traditional blog, it doesn't follow a strict chronological order or demand completeness. It's a space where spontaneous thoughts can be documented - organized or not - for personal reference and public viewing. Think of it as a second brain.

I'm unsure how this will align with my perfectionist tendencies, but it's worth exploring.
